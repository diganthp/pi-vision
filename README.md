# PI V.I.S.I.O.N: Portable Infinitesimal Video Input Signal Processed Intelligent Object Naming
This project is based on SqueezeDet by BichenWuUCB. To the work done by bichenWuUCB, our team added a new feature of determining the distance of the object in real time using the principle of triangular similarity. Using distance as a parameter we could vary the intensity of the haptic motor to alert the user about how near he/she is to the object. We also Integrated Google Assistant which will help the user to get the information he needs and is triggered using a push button.  The whole project was carried out using a Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+. This project was solely based to help the visually impaired people to get through everyday life in a easy way.
